# result:
# (-300, -300) position is number 361201
# (-301, -301) position is number 363609

# (363609 - 361201) / 4 = 602, so the length of the sides of the 300th spiral is 602
# as 361201 is in the right hand corner, and 361201 + 602 = 361503,
# then 361527 must be on the right hand vertical side of the spiral: 361527 - 361201 = 326
# hence 361527 must be at co-ordinate: (-300, 26)

# calculating the manhattan distance:
print("The puzzle answer is: ", abs(0--300) + abs(0-26))
